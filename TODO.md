- Review all places in the spec where $ref may be used; implement and test it.
  - Missing path items!
  - See predefined locations for #/components
- Support serialization: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/serialization/
  - Infer settings from paths when available.
- Validate incomming oapi.
- Tests for decorators
- Additional packages:
  - Package for DTOs: class-validator / class-validators-json-schema (for openapi) / class-transformer
- The world is slowly moving on from express, and fastify's schema validation is interesting.
  - We dont actually have too hard of a dependency on express, we just have:
    - middleware (koa has its own variant, fastify doesnt have this, but has adapters... we would want to support its hooks instead)
    - req/res decorators (koa and fastify have equivalents)
    - we return an express router
  - Abstract out the router generation? Can we do that and still take advantage of the speed benefits / features of each?
- Allow having authenticators be decorators directly on methods in a controller?
