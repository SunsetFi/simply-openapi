Simply OpenAPI Controllers is an ExpressJS compatible OpenAPI-First controller library. It produces fully robust method handlers on controllers by consuming an OpenAPI 3.1 specification and calling your handlers with all data pre-validated and coerced according to your specification.

It exposes its handlers as a single express middleware / router, allowing integration with express itself or with any library or framework that wraps it.

Don't have OpenAPI specs? No problem! SOC also provides decorators for your classes and methods that will create the openapi spec for you according to your handler usage and declaration.

SOC is designed to be a single-purpose library. It solves the use case of producing robust controllers and methods for web request handling, and does not dictate any design patterns beyond what it needs to do its job.\
It is highly extensible, supporting both the typical express middleware, plus its own middleware for method handlers, allowing you to integrate with the method creation for customizing both the inputs and outputs of your controller methods.

At its heart, this library provides two complementary systems:

* The ability to take decorated classes and methods, and produce robust complete OpenAPI specifications from them
* The ability to take OpenAPI specifications and wire them up to handlers, with all the boilerplate validation taken care of automatically.

## Pluggable everywhere

Need a different serialization type? Need additional transformations on inputs before passing them to your methods? Have custom schema properties that need validation? Want to integrate with your own DI server? All of these things are supported in @simply-openapi/controllers through its highly extensible plugin and middleware system.

At the basics, express middleware is supported out of the box. Not only can you simply include your express middleware in your own express app before using the route generated by this library, but you can also add middleware to all controllers, specific controllers, and even specific methods.

A middleware system for handlers is provided, allowing both the inputs to your methods as well as the method responses to be tweaked, transformed, and handled with ease. As with express middlewares, these middlewares can be injected at the global level, class level, and individual methods.

SOC even uses this middleware system for its own core features, meaning any middleware you provide can override any default behavior of SOC. Need specialized handling of your method response to your express response? Need customized error handling? Want to return DTOs from your methods and serialize them dependent on request content types? No problem! Provide a handler middleware and you are good to go!

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use SOC:

* [Produce both routers and OpenAPI schema from controllers and handler methods using decorators](docs/tutorial-controllers-with-automatic-openapi-generation.md) - Use this method if you do not wish to write your own OpenAPI specification and want to focus on writing handlers.
* [Produce routers from predefined OpenAPI schema and annotated controllers](../../readme/controllers/tutorial-binding-to-existing-openapi-spec.md) - Use this method if you want to have strongly declared API contracts that are auditable from outside the code.
